Day13(b)-F(solo)[gun and bat]:

You dart out from behind the dumpsters and beginning sprinting at full speed.
You avoid the first shambler completely and shove aside the second.
Before you can regain momentum, the third shambler dives at you, knocking you to the ground.

You topple over as the creature tries to bite at you. 
Unable to fight back, you cover your face and try to avoid damage but it's already too late.
