Day13(g)-F(solo)[gun and bat]:

You look in the dumpster and find an empty glass bottle.
You aim the bottle away from the carports and throw it.
The shamblers are distracted momentarily, as they shuffle toward the sound of glass shattering.

You sprint toward the carports.
As you turn the corner, you whip your keys out as you spot your car.
You unlock the doors and quickly get in. 

You close the door and lock it while sliding the key into the ignition.
As you hear your engine turn over, the shamblers appear from around the corner.

You put the car in reverse and drive right over the sidewalk, ignoring the embankment, altogether.
You first impulse is to get far away.
