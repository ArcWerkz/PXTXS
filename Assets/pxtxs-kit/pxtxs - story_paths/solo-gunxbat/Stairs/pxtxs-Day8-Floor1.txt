Day8(g)-S(solo)[gun and bat]:

Because the smoke is still thin, you assume the fires were set recently.
You rush down to the second floor, and seeing as smoke is now billowing from the open doorway, you conclude the fire was set there. 

Nothing seems to be moving around, and there is no way to proceed into floor two so you continue on.
Just below you, you hear shuffling footsteps and groans.
The electricity seems to be failing, as floor one's landing is nearly pitch black.
You can see the red auxillary lights reflecting off of the first floor door that is wide open.

A single shambler stumbles up the stairs at such a slow pace, you have plenty of time to think of a winning strategy.

You decide to kick it down the stairs instinctively.
The force of your kick sends the shambler tumbling back down the stairs, and finally, landing on its neck.
As you continue, you recall the young lady that approached your door earlier.

You shove the corpse out of the way and continue onto the first floor.
