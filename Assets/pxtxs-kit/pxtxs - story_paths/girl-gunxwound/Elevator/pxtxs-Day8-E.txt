Day8(b)-E(girl)[gun and bat]:

The elevator doors slide open, as you grip your bat.
The first one approaches and your only thought is knocking the shamblers' heads clean off of their shoulders.

The first swing cracks the bat, but sends the creature flying to the side. You ready yourself for the next shambler.
The moment you make contact with the shambler's jaw, the bat breaks.
The force of the blow was only enough to stun it for a split-second. 
Before you have time to react, Alex pulls the gun from the small of your back she fires and grazes its ear.
The shambler lungest you before Alex can fire another shot.

Defensively, you raise your arm as the shambler goes in for a bite.

You feel your forearm being gnawed at and the meat being torn from bone.
Alex smacks the creature in the temple with the butt of the gun.
She fires a shot into the back of the creature's head, spraying the elevator with brains and blood. 

You kick the body off and drag the two out of the elevator.

Once inside, Alex drops the bag and removes the First Aid Kit.
After disinfecting the wound and giving you painkillers, she bandages the wound.

You look at her in awe and stutter as you thank her.
Don't worry about it, "My dad was Special Forces."

You feel a bit better, despite not knowing how the virus spreads or whether or not you're infected.
Alex puts the backpack back on without saying another word.
