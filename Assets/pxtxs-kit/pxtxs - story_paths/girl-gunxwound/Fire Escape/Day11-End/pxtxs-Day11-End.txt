Day11(b)-F(girl)[gun and wound]:

You both sprint towards the red lights of the exit door.
Half-blinded by the smoke, you fail to notice the shambler, idling in a nearby doorway.
Before you can react, it is on top of you, pinning you down.
The first set of teeth pierce your throat, as you watch the shamblers spill out of the tiny apartment. 
As you succumb to the smoke and the pain, you hear gunshots, interrupted by Alex's screams.
This is the end.
