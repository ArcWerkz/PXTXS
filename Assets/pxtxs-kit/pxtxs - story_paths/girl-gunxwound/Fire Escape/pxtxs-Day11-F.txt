Day11(g)-F(girl)[gun and wound]:

You move through the hallway at a steady pace, making sure to 
check your peripherals for any lurkers as the smoke thins out.
You are about five feet from the door, when you both notice one of the apartment doors is wide open.

Before you know it, a shambler is fast approaching.
Alex fires a shot at its head, and it drops to the ground, twitching.

You hear the groans and snarls of several other shamblers coming from the same direction
and sprint for the exit.
