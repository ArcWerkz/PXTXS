Day3n:
You watch her, silently through the peephole, without uttering another word.
She lingers for a minute or two, then darts down the hall, as if being chased. 
Still watching through the peephole, you witness five of the creatures, shambling down the hall in her direction.

Moments later, you hear screams coming from her direction, then all is silent again.
Your first instinct is to peek out of your door, and survey the corridor but self preservation prevents you from doing so.

You feel bad about ignoring her, but atleast you're still alive.
