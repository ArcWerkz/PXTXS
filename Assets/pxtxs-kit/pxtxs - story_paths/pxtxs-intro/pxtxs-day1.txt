Day1:
You look out of the peephole to see a young lady that appears no older than 20, visibly shaken. Black mascara streams down her face, as she stands in front of the door, sobbing. She's scantily-clothed and seems hysterical. 

"Hello?!" She calls out, looking around warily.

You answer through the door, without so much as unlocking it.

"Can you please let me in?! These...things are after me! Please, I don't want to die!" She becomes more hysterical the more she explains.

"I was here visiting a friend, and got attacked while I was outside for a cab. I just need to use a phone and to get away from these things!"

You ponder for a moment before making a decision.
