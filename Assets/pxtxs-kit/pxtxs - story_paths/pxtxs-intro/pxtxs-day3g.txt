Day3g:
You unlatch your door, and open it slowly. She stumbles in, eyes wide with terror, and collapses to the floor.
She seems to be in shock. Her arms are bruised and covered in scratches. Her legs are no diferrent. 

You carry her to the couch and lay her down gently. You place a sheet over her, and allow her to rest. Unsure of what to expect when she comes to, you prepare some coffee and try to steel your nerves for what may come next. You can't help but watch her, wondering how she survived without being bitten. 

She fits in her sleep, shifting her position, while muttering about dying.
