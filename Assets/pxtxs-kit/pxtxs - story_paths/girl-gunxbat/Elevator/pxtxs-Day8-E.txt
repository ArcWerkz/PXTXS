Day8(g)-E(solo)[gun and bat]:

The doors slide open as you press your press your back against the back wall of the elevator and steady your aim. 
The first shot penetrates the skull of the creature with enough force to send the second one stumbling backwards, 
giving you enough time to fire a clear shot into its forehead, just as it sets its gaze on you again.

You exhale and quickly take another breath, as the elevator doors close.
