Day7-E(girl)[gun and bat]:
You press the down button to call the elevator. 
The chime sounds to notify you that it has reached your floor.
Unfortunately, it seems to have alerted the shamblers nearby as well.

The silent hallway has become alive with the sound of shuffling feet and groans.
Your anxiety becomes clear, as your hands shake, waiting for the doors to open.

As the elevator doors slide open, you let out a sigh of relief and instruct her to get in first.
You press the button to reach the Ground floor.

Just as the doors begin to slide closed, a decayed hand reaches in to pry them open.

You consider your options as the shamblers work at the doors.

Choice1: Use your gun.

Choice2: Use your bat to fend them off.
