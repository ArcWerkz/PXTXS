Day7-S(girl)[gun and bat]:

You decide against the elevator and approach the doors leading to the stairs.
The cool, dim lighting does not pose much of a problem for you as you descend to the fourth floor landing.
The stench is another question. Rotting flesh and the putrescent odor of death spills into your nostrils, making it hard to breathe freely.

You detect the faint smell of smoke.

"You smell that?" Alex whispers in a soft tone.

You consider the fact that you are not alone, and as reassuring it must be for Alex, you are terrified by the sense of responsibility you feel.

You catch your breath for a brief moment before looking back at Alex, and nodding to indicate you're moving on then proceed to the third floor landing.
The smell of smoke begins to overpower the stench of dead bodies.

Alex tries to supress her cough, aware of the danger you both are in.

The smoke has become thicker and the temperature has risen considerably, making the handrails nearly too hot to touch.
As you begin to feel the effects of inhaling smoke, you decide it may be a good idea to think before moving forward.

Choice1: Continue downstairs, but pick up the pace.

Choice2: Duck into the third floor and check the elevators.

Choice3: Return to the fourth floor and check the elevators.
