Day8(b)-S(girl)[gun and bat]:


You and Alex backtrack upstairs to the fourth floor. Just as you clench the handle, the door flies open revealing a hallway full of shamblers. You are knocked off of your feet, toppling Alex in the process. Before you can scramble to your feet, you feel the weight of multiple shamblers pressing on your body.

You hear gunshots and recal that Alex is armed. The firing continues for a brief moment then ends abruptly. 
You take a last glimpse at Alex who is now in the same predicament and mouth the words "I'm sorry." 

Their jagged, rotting teeth seek into your body in more places than you can defend, leaving you powerless against the assault. You know this is the end.
