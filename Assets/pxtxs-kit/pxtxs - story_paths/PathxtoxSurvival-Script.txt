Day1:
You look out of the peephole to see a young lady that appears no older than 20, visibly shaken. Black mascara streams down her face, as she stands in front of the door, sobbing. She's scantily-clothed and seems hysterical. 

"Hello?!" She calls out, looking around warily.

You answer through the door, without so much as unlocking it.

"Can you please let me in?! These...things are after me! Please, I don't want to die!" She becomes more hysterical the more she explains.

"I was here visiting a friend, and got attacked while I was outside for a cab. I just need to use a phone and to get away from these things!"

You ponder for a moment before making a decision. 


Day2:
"If I open this door, and those things are out there..."
You think.

"On the other hand," you think, "if I leave her out there, she'll make it easier for those things to find me, with all the screaming and crying."

As you ponder, you become more and more aware that time is of the essence. You begin to hear footsteps in the distance, getting closer and louder. 
Her voice becomes louder, almost piercing the silence in the well-lit corridor.

Whether you want to or not, you're forced to make a decision:

Day3g: Let her in.

Day3n: Ignore her, and keep quiet.

Day3b: Tell her to leave.


Day3g:
You unlatch your door, and open it slowly. She stumbles in, eyes wide with terror, and collapses to the floor.
She seems to be in shock. Her arms are bruised and covered in scratches. Her legs are no diferrent. 

You carry her to the couch and lay her down gently. You place a sheet over her, and allow her to rest. Unsure of what to expect when she comes to, you prepare some coffee and try to steel your nerves for what may come next. You can't help but watch her, wondering how she survived without being bitten. 

She fits in her sleep, shifting her position, while muttering about dying. 


Day3n:
You watch her, silently through the peephole, without uttering another word.
She lingers for a minute or two, then darts down the hall, as if being chased. 
Still watching through the peephole, you witness five of the creatures, shambling down the hall in her direction.

Moments later, you hear screams coming from her direction, then all is silent again.
Your first instinct is to peek out of your door, and survey the corridor but self preservation prevents you from doing so.

You feel bad about ignoring her, but atleast you're still alive.


Day3b:
"Go away! I can't help you." You yell.
The girl falls silent for a brief second, then she begins screaming obscenities while pounding on the door fiercely.
She looks down the hall and begins striking the door furiously, begging to be let in.

You refuse. 

Through the peephole, you watch her get mauled. 
You surmise that by now, those things have been alerted to your voice, as well. 

With no way out of the tiny apartment, you can only hope that your door can withstand the bodies throwing themselves at it.
Before long, the door collapses, and the shamblers are upon you. Before you can find a weapon, you feel the sensation of teeth piercing your flesh. This is the end, and you know it.


Day4g:
She wakes up abruptly, as if recovering from a nightmare, sweating and panting.
She looks to you with a blank expression, then sits up. She seems to be awake.

"How long was I out?" She asks, slurring her speech a bit. You didn't notice before, but for some reason, you can smell the alcohol she must have drank at the party she mentioned in her sleep.

"Only a few minutes." You reply.

"Thanks for letting me in. You literally saved my life." She mutters, still seemingly in shock.

You ask her for her name.

"Alex, Alex Whitter" She replies, as if her name bears some weight.

You fall silent. Just as you sip your coffee, you realize that there is a chance she may be infected.

You begin theorizing the amount of time it would take for the infection to take over the human body, and if you would have a chance of surviving a sudden attack should she turn.

Either way, you have to be sure of the risks.


You turn to her and consider your approach before asking:

Day5g: "We have to get you cleaned up so we can check for infections. I'll have a change of clothes for you. You can use my shower."


Day5n: "You're scratched up pretty bad. Were you bitten by one of those things?"


Day5b: Say nothing.


Day4n:
After you shake off the thought of that innocent woman being mauled,
you look out of the window, and notice that there's commotion across the street. 
A large multitude of the shamblers are making their way toward your complex. Their numbers seem to be growing at an overwhelming rate. 

"If I stay here, I'm dead." You think out loud.

Day5n-s:
You turn on the T.V. once more to find any updates on the current situation. The once lively news cast is now replaced by a public emergency broadcast recording.

You try a few other channels before realizing that a large majority of stations are running the same broadcast.
A wave of panic washes over you, as you realize that in an hour, local T.V. has been disrupted by the sudden outbreak.

You turn on the radio and maintain a low volume to assess the situation.

A voice breaks through with instructions:

"To any able-bodied citizens out there, we have a safe haven just outside of the city. We're in the boatyard for now. Please hurry, as we may not be able to hold our position for much longer. We estimate departure in about 20 hours."

You take notes in a small steno notepad as the voice gives coordinates to the ship's location.
With that, you decide that it's time to pack what you can and make your way to a safer place.

You rummage through your closet and find your outdoor gear. You retrieve a black metal box from underneath your bed.

You open the box to reveal a box of cigarettes, a habit you quit last year, a small handgun, and $200.00.

Satisfied with the contents, you tuck the handgun in the small of your back.
You close the box and lock it before placing it in your backpack.
You immediately change into your hiking boots, jeans and a thermal sweater. You grab your cellphone, baseball bat and your backpack and head to the bathroom for your First Aid Kit.


You head to the kitchen and grab a few cans of soup, ramen noodles, and a flashlight.



Day5g:
She agrees then gets up and makes her way to the bathroom. 
Just as you hear the shower running, you begin to seriously contemplate what needs to happen next.

The more you sit and stare out of the window, the more you realize you won't be able to remain in your apartment for long.
You turn on the T.V. once more to find any updates on the current situation. The once lively news cast is now replaced by a public emergency broadcast recording.

You try a few other channels before realizing that a large majority of stations are running the same broadcast.
A wave of panic washes over you, as you realize that in an hour, local T.V. has been disrupted by the sudden outbreak.

The young woman approaches wearing one of your shirts and some sweat shorts. Her hair is still damp and the mismatched socks she's wearing are a farcry from the stillettos she was wearing moments prior. She leans over the couch peering over your shoulder, in disbeleif as she watches you cycle through channels unsuccessfully. 

"Feeling any better?" You ask.

"Y-yeah." she replies, in a raspy voice, hoarse from screaming.

You decide now is a good time as any to check her for bites. Better than finding out the wrong way.

You ask her to politely lift the shirt, and with little reluctancy, she complies. 

"Well, you did just save my life..." she remarks.

You ask her for her name.
"Alex, Alex Whitter" She replies, as if her name bears some weight.


You notice some scrapes and scratches, but nothing resembling bite marks. 
She lets out a sigh of frustration, but remains patient, as you both scan her body for any bites or infections.

She appears to be clear of infections. 

"I got most of these from hopping the gate out front to get back onto the property. Those things were everywhere!" she shudders at the thought of the creatures chasing her.

"I'm glad you made it to safety. I'm not going to lie to you, we can't stay here long. We'll just be sitting ducks. I'll check the radio for any evacuation instructions. I've made some coffee for you, as well. Try your best to relax for now."

She mouths the words "Thank you" then proceeds to the tiny kitchen to pour herself a large cup.

You sit beside her after turning on the radio.

A voice breaks through with instructions:

"To any able-bodied citizens out there, we have a safe haven just outside of the city. We're in the boatyard for now. Please hurry, as we may not be able to hold our position for much longer. We estimate departure in about 20 hours."

You head to your room and retrieve a black metal box from underneath your bed.

You open the box to reveal a box of cigarettes, a habit you quit last year, a small handgun, and $200.00.

Satisfied with the contents, you tuck the handgun in the small of your back.
You close the box and lock it before placing it in your backpack.







Day5n:
She looks at you, as if half-dazed by your question. 
"I-I don't know," she replies shakily.
"One minute, I was waiting for a cab when I saw someone limping toward me. I thought nothing of it at first until the cab pulled up, honking. Before I knew it, whoever was coming towards me was suddenly rushing the driver with more of those things!" she put her face in her hands, and began sobbing. 

You try to comfort her, but you can pretty much tell that she's way too distraught to explain herself calmly. 
You place your hand on her shoulder and begin to speak, until you hear a low, growl coming from her.
Just as she bites at your hand, you instinctively jump back, avoiding any damage.

You run toward your room, thinking you can block her until you find a decent weapon.
The snarls and growls intensify as the change becomes more and more evident. She claws and scratches at the door. You bar the door with a chair and begin surveying the room for a weapon. You recall the baseball bat in the corner of your room.

Knowing the chair won't hold for long, you grip the bat firmly and ready yourself for when she breaks in.
Not even a split-second later, the door crashes open, and the chair is overturned. 
She looks up at you with expressionless pale eyes, sunken into her skull, her skin covered in brown and green lesions. 

She lets out one more growl.

**WHAM!** The blow from the shabby old bat connects with her head. You hear the bat crack, and realize there aren't many swings left. She staggers backward, stunned for a brief moment. You lay into her with the cracked bat once more. The force of the blow snaps the bat in half and sends her crashing backward and to the floor, as brain matter sprays the wall. 

You catch your breath, and try to assess your next move. 
By now, more of them will be coming this way after the noise.

With that, you decide that it's time to pack what you can and make your way to a safer place.
You rummage through your closet and find your outdoor gear. You immediately change into your hiking boots, jeans and a thermal sweater. You grab your cellphone, your backpack, and head to the bathroom for your First Aid Kit.

You head to the kitchen and grab a few cans of soup, ramen noodles, and a flashlight.
With your baseball bat out of commission, you consider the few options you have left for arming yourself. 

You dart back to your room, vaulting over the corpse, and retrieve a black metal box from underneath your bed.

You open the box to reveal a box of cigarettes, a habit you quit last year, a small handgun, and $200.00.
You remove the handgun and tuck it in the small of your back. You place the box in your backpack.
Satisfied with your gear, you turn on the radio and maintain a low volume to assess the situation.

A voice breaks through with instructions:

"To any able-bodied citizens out there, we have a safe haven just outside of the city. We're in the boatyard for now. Please hurry, as we may not be able to hold our position for much longer. We estimate departure in about 20 hours."

You take notes in a small steno notepad as the voice gives coordinates to the ship's location.




Day5b:

You silently contemplate the possibility of being eaten by a stranger you just helped moments ago. 
The image of your own sloppy demise flashing in your head is almost enough to make you kill her preemptively.

You shake the feeling off and turn on the radio and maintain a low volume to assess the situation.
She sits silently, listening to the radio.

You tell her to wait in the living room while you start packing some things.

"W-where are we going?" She asks, in a shaky tone.

"We've gotta get out of here. Those things are already in the complex, so it's only a matter of time..." you reply.

She looks toward the radio, silent again.

With that, you decide that it's time to pack what you can and make your way to a safer place.
You rummage through your closet and find your outdoor gear. You immediately change into your hiking boots, jeans and a thermal sweater. You grab your cellphone and your backpack and head to the bathroom for your First Aid Kit.

You head to the kitchen and grab a few cans of soup, ramen noodles, and a flashlight.

You dart back to your room and retrieve a black metal box from underneath your bed.

She calls for you and you rush into the living room, just in time.

A voice breaks through with instructions:

"To any able-bodied citizens out there, we have a safe haven just outside of the city. We're in the boatyard for now. Please hurry, as we may not be able to hold our position for much longer. We estimate departure in about 20 hours."

You take notes in a small steno notepad as the voice gives coordinates to the ship's location.

As you finish taking notes, you look toward the young lady who now appears to be staring off into space.

She begins convulsing violently and collapses.

As you go to check her vitals, she latches onto your neck and bites down with such force that you begin to gush blood immediately. Before you can wrestle yourself free, she bites at your throat once more. 

You feel the warmth of your own blood as you slip out of consciousness.


Day6(solo)[gun only]:
You look out of your peephole and see nothing but an empty, well-lit hallway.
You put your ear to the door and all seems to be quiet for now. 

Considering where your apartment is located, you realize that you have a hell of a walk ahead of you to reach the carports.
After considering the risks one last time, you say goodbye to your apartment and make your way down the corridor leading to the elevators.

Unfortunately, only one seems to be in service at the moment. 

A momentary sense of panic rushes over you, as you consider the possibility of being ambushed.

The stairs are located behind an adjacent doorway.

The silent hallway has become alive with the sound of shuffling feet and groans.
Your anxiety becomes clear, as your hands shake, waiting for the doors to open.

You hold your breath as the elevator doors slide open.
"All clear." You let out a sigh of relief and step in.

You press the button to reach the Ground floor.

Just as the doors begin to slide closed, a decayed hand reaches in to pry them open.

Day8(g/b)-E(solo)[gun only]:

The doors slide open as you press your press your back against the back wall of the elevator and steady your aim. 
The first shot penetrates the skull of the creature with enough force to send the second one stumbling backwards, 
giving you enough time to fire a clear shot into its forehead, just as it sets its gaze on you again.

You exhale and quickly take another breath, as the elevator doors close.

Day8(g)-E(girl)[gun and bat]:

As the elevator doors slide open, you go for your gun but Alex quickly grabs it and fires two consecutive shots, killing both shamblers in an instant.

She exhales and quickly and takes a deep breath. 
The expression on your face must be one of awe and confusion, as Alex chimes in,
"My dad was Special Forces", with a confident smile.

Day8(b)-E(solo)[gun and bat]:

The elevator doors slide open, as you grip your bat.
The first one approaches and your only thought is knocking the shamblers' heads clean off of their shoulders.

The first swing cracks the bat, but sends the creature flying to the side. You ready yourself for the next shambler.
The moment you make contact with the shambler's jaw, the bat breaks.
The force of the blow was only enough to stun it for a split-second. 
You reach for your gun and try to step back only to trip over the leg of the first shambler.

As you stumble backward, you fire at the creature.
You missed its head and any other vitals.
The creature snarls and then lunger at you.
Defensively, you raise your arm as the shambler goes in for a bite.

You feel your forearm being gnawed at and the meat being torn from bone.
As you wince in pain, you place the pistol underneath the shambler's head and pull the trigger.
Brain and blood splatter the lighting above, tenting everything red.

You kick the body off and drag the two out of the elevator.

Once in side, you drop your bag and train the gun on the doors.
As the elevator doors close, you pull the zippers apart on your backpack and pull out the First Aid Kit.

You treat the wound with antiseptic, disinfect, and bandage it.

You feel a bit better, despite not knowing how the virus spreads or whether or not you're infected.

Before you have time to react, Alex pulls the gun from the small of your back she fires and grazes its ear.
The shambler lungest you before Alex can fire another shot.

Defensively, you raise your arm as the shambler goes in for a bite.

You feel your forearm being gnawed at and the meat being torn from bone.
Alex smacks the creature in the temple with the butt of the gun.
She fires a shot into the back of the creature's head, spraying the elevator with brains and blood. 

You kick the body off and drag the two out of the elevator.

Once inside, Alex drops the bag and removes the First Aid Kit.
After disinfecting the wound and giving you painkillers, she bandages the wound.

You look at her in awe and stutter as you thank her.
Don't worry about it, "My dad was Special Forces."

You feel a bit better, despite not knowing how the virus spreads or whether or not you're infected.
Alex puts the backpack back on without saying another word.


Day9(g)-E(solo)[gun only]:

As the elevator hums while making its descent,
you contemplate the thought of becoming one of those...things.

The elevator comes to a screeching halt at the second floor, 
forcing you to focus on the current pressing matter--why the elevator did not reach the lobby.
The doors slide halfway open, as if blocked by an obstruction.

Smoke begins to fill the elevator.
You cover your face and squeeze out of the narrow space provided.
The smoke is thick, obscuring your vision and making it hard to stand up straight.

There doesn't seem to be any shamblers nearby, but the smell of burning flesh is definitely apparent.

The smoke doesn't seem to be subsiding, and the fire must be spreading on this floor.
The need to get outside becomes mroe pressing every second you waste.

You consider taking the stairs the rest of the way, but recall that there is a fire escape located on the floor somewhere as well.

Choice1: Take the stairs.

Choice2: Look for the fire escape.

Day10(g)-S(solo)[gun only]:

You wince in pain as you grip the door handle, feeling the heat of the metal in your palm.
The door creaks as it swings open slowly. A single female shambler lunges at you just as the door is wide enough to step through.
She looks vaguely familiar, but you don't have time to recall.

You dodge to the side, as her nails graze your face. 
She stumbles past you and you fire at the back of her head, killing her instantly.
You step over the corpse and onto the second floor landing.

As you make your way down, the smoke subsides and you are able to breathe freely.
You proceed past the first floor landing to reach the Lobby.
You grab the door handle and gently swing the door open just enough to peek inside.
You make out the muffled sounds of growling and shuffling feet.

You check your gun one last time, realizing you only have three bullets.
After a series of deep breaths, you step inside. 
You are greeted by a small group of four shamblers, spread out in the hallway.

Your options are few.

Choice1: Run for the Lobby exit.
Choice2: Kill the shamblers then proceed.

You proceed past the first floor landing to reach the Lobby.
You grab the door handle and gently swing the door open just enough to peek inside.
You make out the muffled sounds of growling and shuffling feet.

You check your gun one last time, realizing you only have three bullets.
After a series of deep breaths, you step inside. 
You are greeted by a small group of four shamblers, spread out in the hallway.

Your options are few.

Choice1: Run for the Lobby exit.
Choice2: Kill the shamblers then proceed.

Day10(b)-S(solo)[gun and wound]:

You wince in pain as you grip the door handle, feeling the heat of the metal in your palm.
The door creaks as it swings open slowly. A single female shambler lunges at you just as the door is wide enough to step through.
She looks vaguely familiar, but you don't have time to recall.

You dodge to the side, as her nails graze your face. 
She stumbles past you and you fire at the back of her head, killing her instantly.

Day10(b)-S(girl)[gun and wound]:

You notice that your wound is bleeding out of the dressings.

Alex removes the shirt you gave her and stands in her braw, tearing the shirt into strips.
She wraps your arm until it is tight and secure.
The bledding has been slowed tremendously.

"You offer her your shirt, but she refuses the offer, seemingly unfazed at all."

You wince in pain as you grip the door handle, feeling the heat of the metal in your palm.
The door creaks as it swings open slowly. 
A single female shambler tries to squeeze through the narrow opening.
You smash the door hard against her, smashing her head and shoulder.
Alex leans on the door, applying added weight.
You both silently watch as her eyes roll back and her skull caves in, you can hear her feet shuffling, as she twitches.

You wipe the gore from your face and motion to Alex to move.
You peek out once more and make out the muffled sounds of growling and shuffling feet.

Alex checks the gun one last time, realizing there are only three bullets left.
After a series of deep breaths, you step inside. 
You are greeted by a small group of four shamblers, spread out in the hallway.

You survey the position of the shamblers in relation to the exit.
After realizing just how few bullets you have remaining, 

you grip your pistol and steady your aim, firing a single shot that kills the first shambler.

The second shambler nearby, takes notice of the sound and rushes toward you snarling.
Confident, you fire again, dropping the creature in an instant.
You continue down the hallway slowly, firing your final shot at the third shambler.
The bullet hits its shoulder, causing the creature to spin around before collapsing to the ground.

You pick up speed and send the butt of your pistol crashing into the skull of the final shambler just before reaching the exit.

Day12(g)-S(solo)[gun only]:
As you carefully step outside, the smell of smoke seems to eminate from other sources besides the apartment complex.

Eerily, the immediate area surrounding the complex seems void of living and undead, except for a couple of stragglers several feet away.

You proceed toward the carports in an attempt to reach your car.
As you approach the lot, you hear the shuffle of feet in the distance.

You begin to reconsider your straightforward approach, after witnessing a group of shamblers, wandering near your location.

You decide to take cover near the dumpsters and wait for them to pass.

You dodge as the second shambler lunges toward you.

Before you can clear the small group, you lose your footing and stumble to the floor.
You try to recover your balance but before you can get to your feet again,
the remaining two shamblers are already upon you.

Pinned down, you are forced to resign to your fate.
You shriek in pain as their rotted teeth tear into your flesh...

Before you can react, it is on top of you, pinning you down.
The first set of teeth, piercing your throat are all you can remember, as you succumb to the smoke and the pain.
This is the end.


Day11(b)-F(solo)[gun and bat]:

As you succumb to the smoke and the pain, you hear gunshots, interrupted by Alex's screams.
This is the end.

Day7-S(solo)[gun only]:
You decide against the elevator and approach the doors leading to the stairs.
The cool, dim lighting does not pose much of a problem for you as you descend to the fourth floor landing.
The stench is another question. Rotting flesh and the putrescent odor of death spills into your nostrils, making it hard to breathe freely.

You detect the faint smell of smoke.

"Must be coming from a lower floor", you think to yourself.

You catch your breath for a brief moment then proceed to the third floor landing.
The smell of smoke begins to overpower the stench of dead bodies.

The smoke has become thicker and the temperature has raised considerably, making the handrails nearly too hot to touch.
As you begin to feel the effects of inhaling smoke, you decide it may be a good idea to think before moving forward.

Choice1: Continue downstairs, but pick up the pace.

Choice2: Duck into the third floor and check the elevators.

Choice3: Return to the fourth floor and check the elevators.

You detect the faint smell of smoke.

"You smell that?" Alex whispers in a soft tone.

You consider the fact that you are not alone, and as reassuring it must be for Alex, you are terrified by the sense of responsibility you feel.

You catch your breath for a brief moment before looking back at Alex, and nodding to indicate you're moving on then proceed to the third floor landing.
The smell of smoke begins to overpower the stench of dead bodies.

Alex tries to supress her cough, aware of the danger you both are in.

Day8(g)-S(solo)[gun]:

Because the smoke is still thin, you assume the fires were set recently.
You rush down to the second floor, and seeing as smoke is now billowing from the open doorway, you conclude the fire was set there. 

Nothing seems to be moving around, and there is no way to proceed into floor two so you continue on.
Just below you, you hear shuffling footsteps and groans.
The electricity seems to be failing, as floor one's landing is nearly pitch black.
You can see the red auxillary lights reflecting off of the first floor door that is wide open.

A single female shambler stumbles up the stairs at such a slow pace, you have plenty of time to think of a winning strategy.

You decide to kick her down the stairs instinctively.
The force of your kick sends her tumbling back down the stairs, and finally, landing on her neck.
As you continue, you recall the young lady that approached your door earlier.

A sense of guilt strikes you, as you shove her body out of the way of the first floor entrance.

As you proceed forward,
Alex kicks it down the stairs. You pause for a second, in shock at her reaction time.

The force of her kick sends the shambler tumbling back down the stairs, and finally, landing on its neck.
As you continue, you begin to reconsider what Alex is truly capable of.

You shove the corpse out of the way and continue onto the first floor.


Day8(n)-S(solo)[gun]:
You grab the handle and pull the door open slowly.
You peek into the interior and observe a single crouching figure, illuminated by red auxillary lights.
You make out the sounds of bones snapping and gurgling, as you realize that you are only a couple of feet away from a shambler, enjoying its free meal. 

The figure seems unaware of your presence, as you pry the door open just enough to make your way in.
You try to step as lightly as you can, making sure to avoid any detection. 
You grip your pistol, hoping you won't have to use it.

"On second thought...", you think, as the butt of your pistol comes crashing down on the creature's skull.
You make sure it is dead, then turn your attention to the elevator buttons.
You call for an elevator and wait for the doors to spring open with your pistol poised to fire.

The elevator doors slide open and you are greeted by two shamblers.
You take the first one out with a headshot to the forehead.
The second one lunges forward, tripping over its buddy and grazes you with its nails.

You shrug the shambler off and it hits the floor with a thud. 
You deliver a shot to the back of its head before it can rise again.

Fairly confident there will be more after the gunshots, you rush into the elevator and press the Lobby button.

You grip your bat, knowing what is about to happen next.

Just as the shambler raises its head, you bludgeon the creature until the majority of its skull is caved in.

The elevator doors slide open and you whip around as you are greeted by two shamblers.

You swing the bat, landing a clean hit and cracking the creature's skull.
The second one lunges forward, tripping over its buddy.
You swing at the shambler as it closes the gap, knocking it to the ground.

You deliver a decisive blow to the back of its head before it can rise again.

Fairly confident the shamblers are dead...again, you enter the elevator and press the button for the Lobby.

You signal Alex to stay put, as you try to step as lightly as you can, making sure to avoid any detection. 
You grip your bat, knowing what is about to happen next.

Just as the shambler raises its head, you bludgeon the creature until the majority of its skull is caved in.

The elevator doors slide open and before you can whip around to face the shamblers spilling out, Alex grabs your gun and kills them both in a near-instant.

She turns to you with a satisfied look on her face.
The look on your face is one of shock and intrigue.
"My dad was Special Forces." She states, in a matter-of-fact tone.
You tell her to hold onto the gun, as you both proceed into the elevator.
 

Day8(b)-S(solo)[gun]:

You backtrack upstairs to the fourth floor. Just as you clench the handle, the door flies open revealing a hallway full of shamblers. You are knocked off of your feet before you can recover. As you try to scramble to your feet, you feel the weight of multiple shamblers pressing on your body. 

Their jagged, rotting teeth seek into your body in more places than you can defend and you are powerless against the assault. You know this is the end.

You hear gunshots and recal that Alex is armed. The firing continues for a brief moment then ends abruptly. 
You take a last glimpse at Alex who is now in the same predicament and mouth the words "I'm sorry." 

Their jagged, rotting teeth seek into your body in more places than you can defend, leaving you powerless against the assault. You know this is the end.
