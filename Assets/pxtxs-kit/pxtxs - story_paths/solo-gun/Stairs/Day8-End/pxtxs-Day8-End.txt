Day8(b)-S(solo)[gun]:

You backtrack upstairs to the fourth floor. Just as you clench the handle, the door flies open revealing a hallway full of shamblers. You are knocked off of your feet before you can recover. As you try to scramble to your feet, you feel the weight of multiple shamblers pressing on your body. 

Their jagged, rotting teeth seek into your body in more places than you can defend and you are powerless against the assault. You know this is the end.
