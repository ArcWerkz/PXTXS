Day11(b)-F(solo)[gun only]:

You sprint towards the door, red lights of the exit door.
Half-blinded by the smoke, you fail to notice the shambler, idling in a nearby doorway.
Before you can react, it is on top of you, pinning you down.
The first set of teeth, piercing your throat are all you can remember, as you succumb to the smoke and the pain.
This is the end.
