Day9(g)-E(solo)[gun only]:

As the elevator hums while making its descent,
you contemplate the thought of becoming one of those...things.

The elevator comes to a screeching halt at the second floor, 
forcing you to focus on the current pressing matter--why the elevator did not reach the lobby.
The doors slide halfway open, as if blocked by an obstruction.

Smoke begins to fill the elevator.
You cover your face and squeeze out of the narrow space provided.
The smoke is thick, obscuring your vision and making it hard to stand up straight.

There doesn't seem to be any shamblers nearby, but the smell of burning flesh is definitely apparent.

The smoke doesn't seem to be subsiding, and the fire must be spreading on this floor.
The need to get outside becomes mroe pressing every second you waste.

You consider taking the stairs the rest of the way, but recall that there is a fire escape located on the floor somewhere as well.

Choice1: Take the stairs.

Choice2: Look for the fire escape.
