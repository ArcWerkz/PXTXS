Day13(g)-S(solo)[gun and wound]:
You breathe a sigh of relief as you watch the small herd pass without even noticing you.
You slowly move from your cover behind the dumpsters and sprint toward the carports.
As you turn the corner, you whip your keys out as you spot your car.
You unlock the doors and quickly get in. 

You close the door and lock it while sliding the key into the ignition.
As you hear your engine turn over, the shamblers appear from around the corner.

You put the car in reverse and drive right over the sidewalk, ignoring the embankment, altogether.
You first impulse is to get far away.
