Day8(g)-E(solo)[gun and bat]-w:

The doors slide open as you press your press your back against the back wall of the elevator and steady your aim. 
The first shot penetrates the skull of the creature with enough force to send the second one stumbling backwards, 
giving you enough time to fire a clear shot into its forehead, just as it sets its gaze on you again.

You exhale and quickly take another breath, as the elevator doors close.
Day8(b)-E(solo)[gun and bat]:

The elevator doors slide open, as you grip your bat.
The first one approaches and your only thought is knocking the shamblers' heads clean off of their shoulders.

The first swing cracks the bat, but sends the creature flying to the side. You ready yourself for the next shambler.
The moment you make contact with the shambler's jaw, the bat breaks.
The force of the blow was only enough to stun it for a split-second. 
You reach for your gun and try to step back only to trip over the leg of the first shambler.

As you stumble backward, you fire at the creature.
You missed its head and any other vitals.
The creature snarls and then lunger at you.
Defensively, you raise your arm as the shambler goes in for a bite.

You feel your forearm being gnawed at and the meat being torn from bone.
As you wince in pain, you place the pistol underneath the shambler's head and pull the trigger.
Brain and blood splatter the lighting above, tenting everything red.

You kick the body off and drag the two out of the elevator.

Once in side, you drop your bag and train the gun on the doors.
As the elevator doors close, you pull the zippers apart on your backpack and pull out the First Aid Kit.

You treat the wound with antiseptic, disinfect, and bandage it.

You feel a bit better, despite not knowing how the virus spreads or whether or not you're infected.
