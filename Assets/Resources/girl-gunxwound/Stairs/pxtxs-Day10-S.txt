Day10(b)-S(girl)[gun and wound]:

You notice that your wound is bleeding out of the dressings.

Alex removes the shirt you gave her and stands in her braw, tearing the shirt into strips.
She wraps your arm until it is tight and secure.
The bledding has been slowed tremendously.

"You offer her your shirt, but she refuses the offer, seemingly unfazed at all."

You wince in pain as you grip the door handle, feeling the heat of the metal in your palm.
The door creaks as it swings open slowly. 
A single female shambler tries to squeeze through the narrow opening.
You smash the door hard against her, smashing her head and shoulder.
Alex leans on the door, applying added weight.
You both silently watch as her eyes roll back and her skull caves in, you can hear her feet shuffling, as she twitches.

You wipe the gore from your face and motion to Alex to move.
You peek out once more and make out the muffled sounds of growling and shuffling feet.

Alex checks the gun one last time, realizing there are only three bullets left.
After a series of deep breaths, you step inside. 
You are greeted by a small group of four shamblers, spread out in the hallway.

Your options are few.
You look toward Alex one more time and take a deep breath.

Choice1: Run for the Lobby exit.
Choice2: Kill the shamblers then proceed.
