Day10(g)-F(solo)[gun and bat]:

As the sprinklers dowse everything, including you, you proceed down the corridor, as quickly as possible.
You spend most of the time, holding your breath.

There doesn't seem to be much movement on this floor, as far as you can see. 
You crouch through the hallway, with your gun in hand.
You slow down as you approach an intersection.
You notice the smoke has subsided a bit, and you are able to breathe freely.

You pay no attention to the apartment doors and look only for the emergency exit.
As you pass through hallway, you see the red lights of the exit sign through the thinning black smoke.

Your first instinct is to run for it. 

Choice1: Run for the door.
Choice2: Pace yourself.
