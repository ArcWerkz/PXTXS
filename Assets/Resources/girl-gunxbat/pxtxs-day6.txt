Day6(girl)[gun and bat]:
You look out of your peephole and see nothing but an empty, well-lit hallway.
You put your ear to the door and all seems to be quiet for now. 

Considering where your apartment is located, you realize that you have a hell of a walk ahead of you to reach the carports.
After considering the risks one last time, you say goodbye to your apartment.

You motion for her to stay close to you and make your way down the corridor leading to the elevators. 
Unfortunately, only one seems to be in service at the moment. 

Alex looks at you and you can see the fear in her eyes.
Even as a momentary sense of panic washes over you, you take her hand and reassure her.
You hand her the backpack and she slips it over her shoulders without saying a word.

The stairs are located behind an adjacent doorway. 

Choice1: Call the elevator.

Choice2: Take the stairs.
