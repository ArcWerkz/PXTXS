Day11(b)-S(girl)[gun and bat]:
You survey the position of the shamblers in relation to the exit.
You nod at Alex, who seems unsure of your plan.
After realizing just how few bullets you have remaining, 
you both dart down the hallway.

You dodge the first shambler and gain momentum, as if adrenaline is fueling your speed.
You dodge as the second shambler lunges toward you.
You hear Alex scream in the distance behind you and turn to realize she had bee overtaken.

Before you can regain your focus and keep going, you lose your footing and stumble to the floor.

You try to recover your balance but before you can get to your feet again,
the remaining two shamblers are already upon you.

Pinned down, you are forced to resign to your fate.
You feel sorry for leading Alex to her demise.
You shriek in pain as their rotted teeth tear into your flesh...
