Day13(g)-F(girl)[gun and bat]:

You look in the dumpster and find an empty glass bottle.
You aim the bottle away from the carports and throw it.
The shamblers are distracted momentarily, as they shuffle toward the sound of glass shattering.

You singal Alex to move and you both sprint for the carports.
You turn the corner and whip your keys out as you spot your car.
You quickly unlock your car and get in as Alex scrambles around the side of the car and dives in as well.
You close the doors and lock them while sliding the key into the ignition.

As you hear your engine turn over, the shamblers appear from around the corner.
You put the car in reverse and drive right over the sidewalk, ignoring the embankment, altogether.
You first impulse is to get far away.
