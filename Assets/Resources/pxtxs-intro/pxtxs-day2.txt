Day2:
"If I open this door, and those things are out there..."
You think.

"On the other hand," you think, "if I leave her out there, she'll make it easier for those things to find me, with all the screaming and crying."

As you ponder, you become more and more aware that time is of the essence. You begin to hear footsteps in the distance, getting closer and louder. 
Her voice becomes louder, almost piercing the silence in the well-lit corridor.

Whether you want to or not, you're forced to make a decision:

Day3g: Let her in.

Day3n: Ignore her, and keep quiet.

Day3b: Tell her to leave.
