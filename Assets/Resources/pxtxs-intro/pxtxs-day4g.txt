Day4g:
She wakes up abruptly, as if recovering from a nightmare, sweating and panting.
She looks to you with a blank expression, then sits up. She seems to be awake.

"How long was I out?" She asks, slurring her speech a bit. You didn't notice before, but for some reason, you can smell the alcohol she must have drank at the party she mentioned in her sleep.

"Only a few minutes." You reply.

"Thanks for letting me in. You literally saved my life." She mutters, still seemingly in shock.

You ask her for her name.

"Alex, Alex Whitter" She replies, as if her name bears some weight.

You fall silent. Just as you sip your coffee, you realize that there is a chance she may be infected.

You begin theorizing the amount of time it would take for the infection to take over the human body, and if you would have a chance of surviving a sudden attack should she turn.

Either way, you have to be sure of the risks.


You turn to her and consider your approach before asking:

Day5g: "We have to get you cleaned up so we can check for infections. I'll have a change of clothes for you. You can use my shower."


Day5n: "You're scratched up pretty bad. Were you bitten by one of those things?"


Day5b: Say nothing.
