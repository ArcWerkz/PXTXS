Day3b:
"Go away! I can't help you." You yell.
The girl falls silent for a brief second, then she begins screaming obscenities while pounding on the door fiercely.
She looks down the hall and begins striking the door furiously, begging to be let in.

You refuse. 

Through the peephole, you watch her get mauled. 
You surmise that by now, those things have been alerted to your voice, as well. 

With no way out of the tiny apartment, you can only hope that your door can withstand the bodies throwing themselves at it.
Before long, the door collapses, and the shamblers are upon you. Before you can find a weapon, you feel the sensation of teeth piercing your flesh. This is the end, and you know it.
