Day5n-s:
You turn on the T.V. once more to find any updates on the current situation. The once lively news cast is now replaced by a public emergency broadcast recording.

You try a few other channels before realizing that a large majority of stations are running the same broadcast.
A wave of panic washes over you, as you realize that in an hour, local T.V. has been disrupted by the sudden outbreak.

You turn on the radio and maintain a low volume to assess the situation.

A voice breaks through with instructions:

"To any able-bodied citizens out there, we have a safe haven just outside of the city. We're in the boatyard for now. Please hurry, as we may not be able to hold our position for much longer. We estimate departure in about 20 hours."

You take notes in a small steno notepad as the voice gives coordinates to the ship's location.
With that, you decide that it's time to pack what you can and make your way to a safer place.

You rummage through your closet and find your outdoor gear. You retrieve a black metal box from underneath your bed.

You open the box to reveal a box of cigarettes, a habit you quit last year, a small handgun, and $200.00.

Satisfied with the contents, you tuck the handgun in the small of your back.
You close the box and lock it before placing it in your backpack.
You immediately change into your hiking boots, jeans and a thermal sweater. You grab your cellphone, baseball bat and your backpack and head to the bathroom for your First Aid Kit.


You head to the kitchen and grab a few cans of soup, ramen noodles, and a flashlight.
