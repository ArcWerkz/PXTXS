Day11(g)-S(solo)[gun only]:
You survey the position of the shamblers in relation to the exit.
After realizing just how few bullets you have remaining, 
you decide to dispatch the shamblers with as much efficiency possible.

The first shambler approaches, as the others move toward you in the distance.
You decide not to aler them to your position just yet.

You dodge the first shambler's lunge and quickly counter by slamming its head into the wall.
The force of the impact sends the creature to the floor twitching.

You ready your pistol as the second one approaches, knowing the others will 
be approaching shortly.

One well-placed shot between the eyes drops it to the floor.
The others react hastily and begin moving toward you quicker.

You kill the third with another carefully aimed shot.
Before the fourth can get within reach, you fire your last shot, shattering the side of its skull.

you quickly reach the doors and shut them behind you as you make your way outside.
