Day12(g)-S(solo)[gun only]:
As you carefully step outside, the smell of smoke seems to eminate from other sources besides the apartment complex.

Eerily, the immediate area surrounding the complex seems void of living and undead, except for a couple of stragglers several feet away.

You proceed toward the carports in an attempt to reach your car.
As you approach the lot, you hear the shuffle of feet in the distance.

You begin to reconsider your straightforward approach, after witnessing a group of shamblers, wandering near your location.

You decide to take cover near the dumpsters and wait for them to pass.
