Day10(g)-S(solo)[gun only]:

You wince in pain as you grip the door handle, feeling the heat of the metal in your palm.
The door creaks as it swings open slowly. A single female shambler lunges at you just as the door is wide enough to step through.
She looks vaguely familiar, but you don't have time to recall.

You dodge to the side, as her nails graze your face. 
She stumbles past you and you fire at the back of her head, killing her instantly.
You step over the corpse and onto the second floor landing.

As you make your way down, the smoke subsides and you are able to breathe freely.
You proceed past the first floor landing to reach the Lobby.
You grab the door handle and gently swing the door open just enough to peek inside.
You make out the muffled sounds of growling and shuffling feet.

You check your gun one last time, realizing you only have three bullets.
After a series of deep breaths, you step inside. 
You are greeted by a small group of four shamblers, spread out in the hallway.

Your options are few.

Choice1: Run for the Lobby exit.
Choice2: Kill the shamblers then proceed.
