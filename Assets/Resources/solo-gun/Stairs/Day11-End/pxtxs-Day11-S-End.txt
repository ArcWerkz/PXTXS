Day11(b)-S(solo)[gun only]:
You survey the position of the shamblers in relation to the exit.
After realizing just how few bullets you have remaining, 
you dart down the hallway.

You dodge the first shambler and gain momentum, as if adrenaline is fueling your speed.
You dodge as the second shambler lunges toward you.

You try to recover your balance but before you can get to your feet again,
the remaining two shamblers are already upon you.

Pinned down, you are forced to resign to your fate.
You shriek in pain as their rotted teeth tear into your flesh...
