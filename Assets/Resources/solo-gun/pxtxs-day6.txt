Day6(solo)[gun only]:
You look out of your peephole and see nothing but an empty, well-lit hallway.
You put your ear to the door and all seems to be quiet for now. 

Considering where your apartment is located, you realize that you have a hell of a walk ahead of you to reach the carports.
After considering the risks one last time, you say goodbye to your apartment and make your way down the corridor leading to the elevators.

Unfortunately, only one seems to be in service at the moment. 

A momentary sense of panic rushes over you, as you consider the possibility of being ambushed.

The stairs are located behind an adjacent doorway. 



Choice1: Call the elevator.

Choice2: Take the stairs.
