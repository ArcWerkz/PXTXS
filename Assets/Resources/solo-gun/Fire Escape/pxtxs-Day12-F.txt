Day12(g)-F(solo)[gun only]:

You make it outside and onto the steel landing.
You look down, realizing you don't have much farther to go.
Knowing how close you are to your car seems to restore your vigor.
You can see the carports from where you are standing, and also a small group of shamblers.

You make your descent down the first set of steps and onto the landing facing the ladder.
You carefully unlatch the locking mechanism and slowly lower the ladder, 
concentrating on not making any excess noise.

The shamblers seem to be unaware of your presence still.
You make your descent and find cover behind a pair of dumpsters while watching the shamblers.

Aware that you are low on bullets, you consider your options.

Choice1: Look for something to throw as a distration.
Choice2: Pick them off then run for it.
